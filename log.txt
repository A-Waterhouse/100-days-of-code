day2 
17/1/23

installed prettier plugin for vs code and how to use auto format shortcut (shift+alt+F)
chrome dev tools
edit index on the fly
using <P></P> for line breaks
making links to external resources
using anchor tag <a></a> and href= attributes
using nested elements anchor tag<a> inside paragraph tag<p>
using style element <style> with css rules/global rules
CSS selector "p" for type, all paragraph elements have properties between {}
p {
    font-family: sans-serif;
    text-align: center;
}
The selector (p in the above example) and the opening curly brace typically go into the same line
You then have one CSS property + its value per line
Every line MUST end with a semi-colon
The lines are indented (automatically, via the "Format Document" shortcut or because you pressed TAB)

The closing curly brace goes into a separate line, with no indentation
making code more readable, less elements
using meta info for the browser not visable to the user, seperating the 2 using <head> and <body>
adding <title>
setting <!DOCTYPE html>
using tab or enter for autocomplete
moving text around using alt+up or down once selected
added comments <!-- html comments--> for html and  /* css comments */ for css

day3

edited links using the a style, added underline whn hovering over link using text-decoration also changed colour of link using tyle atributes for <a>
styles can overide each other and inherit preious styles from <p>
added styles to seperate *.css file in same directory and linked it to the html file using link element and href <link rel="stylesheet" href="andys-styles.css" />
used rel (relation ) atribute
used the network tab in dev tools to see what files are being used (andys-styles.css)
used id on html elements <p id="todays-challenge"> addec css rule to andys-styles
changed font size using pixels px to make it absolute value for different resolutions
added fonts from google fonts to html file using links
used fallback fonts (font-family: "Anton", sans-serif) sans-serif will be applied if googlefonts is offline etc.
added image to html using img, chenged size using width and height in pixels, put it in circle using border
centered image by centering content in the body tag, img is void element therefore has no content, img is content of body so can be centered
targeted the higher level/parent to center image
removed text align from h1 and p since it is already used in parent, body

added 2nd html file to show rest of week tasks

used ! to make skeleton template with meta data added
linked to full_week.html from the index.html file
shared css file across multiple html files
tidied up directory, made images and style sheets folders, linked to new paths in css an html
because matrix.png was in a css file to set background, the path had to be changed since computer aws looking in stylesheets/images instead of images, .. was used to state that ../images/matrix.png was in the root directory.
installed live dev server plugin

day 5
Made github account and uploaded files
created lists from paragraphs <p>, ordered lists <OL> an <UL> unordered lists
used list-style withing the lists
used inspect to see how the properties hierarchy works within nesting
used box model in css with margins borders and background colours within <h> or <a>
padding can be used top, right, bottom and left px to make square round text
border can be size and property of 
linemargin can have left and right properties
used padding to make page look better and centered list correctly using margins
structured html file correctly to make easier to read, header, h1,a,header. main,P
using the class selector, can be used for multiple elements
using decendent combinators (similar to #element targets) and setting rules to ancestors, parents and childs eg. body h1 {} can be used to set parameters of h1(s) within body, used to target specific paragraphs etc.
combinators (body p etc) should be used rather then #targets
added headings and paragraphs to the ordered lists to enable use of combinators
