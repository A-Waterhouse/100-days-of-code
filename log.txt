day2 
17/1/23

installed prettier plugin for vs code and how to use auto format shortcut (shift+alt+F)
chrome dev tools
edit index on the fly
using <P></P> for line breaks
making links to external resources
using anchor tag <a></a> and href= attributes
using nested elements anchor tag<a> inside paragraph tag<p>
using style element <style> with css rules/global rules
CSS selector "p" for type, all paragraph elements have properties between {}
p {
    font-family: sans-serif;
    text-align: center;
}
The selector (p in the above example) and the opening curly brace typically go into the same line
You then have one CSS property + its value per line
Every line MUST end with a semi-colon
The lines are indented (automatically, via the "Format Document" shortcut or because you pressed TAB)

The closing curly brace goes into a separate line, with no indentation
making code more readable, less elements
using meta info for the browser not visable to the user, seperating the 2 using <head> and <body>
adding <title>
setting <!DOCTYPE html>
using tab or enter for autocomplete
moving text around using alt+up or down once selected
added comments <!-- html comments--> for html and  /* css comments */ for css

=================================================================================================
day 10 & 11
26&27/1/23

note for what tutor did different

made page from picture, day9.html
block elements use full width of browser, dont allow elements next to them, uses line break
inline allows elements next to each other, doesnt use line break
use width property to keep ratio of image
img should be within header element
should use h1 instead of a, and h2 instead of h1
h1 should not be nested in OL
ul was used instead of OL
set style within main instead of OL
margin left right auto wil center block elements
border left was used instead of box shadow in the ul to higlight some points
span was used to make word bold instead of b
keep tag and class selectors together and organised in the css file
tutor used a:hover, a:active to change link to style link so it looks like button and changes colour when hovered over
target property can be used to open link in new tab target=_blank


<em> or <strong> element can be used to highlight words which are read out of blind people <strong> makes it bold
<section> element is used to make code easier to read

finished on video 161
=================================================================================================
day 19
9/2/23

compared my attempt with tutors
he used grid instead of flex

leared about pixel scales and problems it can cause with user settings
pixels are unscalable
learned about % em and rem for font sizing
% relative to parent element size
em relative to font size
rem relative to elements root font size
enabling users to change font size in browser

when % is used for padding etc then it takes results from parent value, if no parent value it can take it from width
when em is used for paddding etc it takes results from parent value, if no parent value it can take it from font size
rem will do same but take result from root font size
em and rem always relate to font size
use rem for fonts and mix of rem and % px for other properties

changed values in tutors solution page to rem etc...
page fonts now respond correctly to resizing for different devices
left borders in px as they should not scale with page size

videos about tips to make site styled well
keep content centered
give centent space 
group elements with similar information together

give bigger font weights to titles and key information
bigger size fonts for titles and key info
try to use only 2 fonts, 1 serif and 1 sans serif

colours, use grey for background colour, pure black looks unatural for text also use grey tones
changes focus for titles and sub headers
use a primary colour for theme gives website identity
an accent colour can be used to highlight
presets can be used, css variables, must be placed in html {} in css
--color-grey-100: rgb(236, 236, 236);
background-color: var(--color-grey-100);
predefined scales can be changed all at once
can be used for font sizes etc... var(var--size-1)
varables only available for elements which are nested within that elements (html holds all elements)

use transformations and transitions, eg transform: scale (2);
transformations can be used in hover states
transitions should be used in default states, eg transition: transform 0.5s ease-out 1s;

<input type=""> type is text, numbers, email etc..
<textarea> multiline text input fields
<select> used for dropdown options
<button> confirming inputs/submitting form/reseting form

input can be styled in the css file
<form> elemnt must be added to make functional
action atribute sends data to path set (website or database/server)
method atribute chooses type of http request sent to server(GET and POST)
GET tell browser to receive data, data is now part of url separated by &
POST tell browser to store data, data will be meta data

backend server needs to be set up to use either GET or POST

use <lable> to title form inputs
input must have id <input id/> to link label to using <label for="">
allows to click on title of input to focus on input

used font:inherit to override browser deault style in the button css, inherit from body

learned about different types of inputs, eg text (default), email, number, password, date, radio buttons, checkbox, file.
different inputs allow for different keyboards and other properties (special keyboards, vaildation)
<input type="number" step="5" name="user-age" id="userage"> step can be used to skip numbers using the arrows

help user and gives them better experience

used <hr> to add horizontal line to the form

radio buttons must have same name to group them together so only 1 can be picked
value is used to pre enter data in forms
value in radio buttons is used for machine readable value

learned about dropdowns, check boxes and how data is sent to servers using value

grouped forms inputs into sections and lists to tidy up the code

finished on video 211
=================================================================================================

day 24
19/2/23

learned about validation on forms and adding novalidate attribute to form to override
added atribute required to input to make sure something is typed in
added atribute required to password to enable minlength
attribute added to age min and max to make min age required
for date required min="1921-01-01" max="2003-01-01" must be in that format yyyy-mm-dd
date will now be restricted to those dates 

required can be used on radio buttons
enables warning in forms for missing data

placeholder atribute is used to add greyed out text into box, differs from value since value is like user typed it, can be used as hint 

risize handle on message box can be disabled in css so design stays how you want it 
textarea{
    resize: none;
}
can be used vertically or horizontaly

attempted challenge using leared skills, worked out OK but buttons were aligned differently

finished on video 218
=================================================================================================

day 25
22/2/23

learned about javascript, aded alerts and linked html file to external file using <script src="app.js"></script>
used arrays using the [] brackets, elements seperated by commas and in quotation
alert(hobbies[0]); displays 1st element of saved array
used properties within objects let job = { title: "developer", place: "new york", salary: 50000 }; to keep object variables related
like variables closed into that object
alert(job.title); shows the requested properties within the object using the . character
derived vaules from formulas and displayed output let adultYears = age - 18; alert(adultYears);
used functions to store formular
function calculateAdultYears (){
    adultYears =  age - 18
}
calculateAdultYears();
alert (adultYears);

age = 19;

day 26
23/2/23

attempted excercise.js challenge 
part 1 - 5 were done correct and worked
part 5&6 were done differently but still worked, tutors had 2 less lines of code

learned to put functions into an object called methods
used console.log instead of alert

made mathoperations.js file
did some equations and displayed output in console
whole numbers are integers
numbers with decimals are floating point numbers or floats
used modulus operator % shows remainder from division eg 10/4 is 4*2 with 2 remaining
learned about linear equations using bodmas rules

javascript calculates right side of = first
result = result + 1; so result+1 can be calculated and stored as result
can be writtern as result++ instead
result-- can be used also to subtract 1
result += 5; result = result + 5
Exponentiation operator (i.e. replacement for age = 4 * 4 * 4)

+ can be used on stings also eg console.log("Andy" +" "+ "Waterhouse");

console.log(userName.length); used to calculate length of string, can also count objects in array


DOM section
learnd about window console.log(window) so we can view information about opened tab
DOM is Document Object model, the data representation of the parsed HTML code
javascript can interact with it, extract an manipulate data

used defer to delay loading of html until js is loaded

document.body.children[1].children[0].href = 'http://www.google.com'; was used to change url from within the js file




finished on video 260
=================================================================================================
day 27
26/2/23

learned about DOM tree and how it is similar to HTML
drilled into document to find the DOM code document.body.children[1].children[0].href to get the path for js
can use query elements to drill into the DOM may be an easier way to get the DOM address

can live type into the console in dev tools to help drill intot he DOM using previews
elements and text pieces are stored seperately in the DOM
TEXT NODES the white space is part of the DOM read as text/spaces, first child nodes may be the white spaces

document.body.firstElementChild accesses the h1 element
or document.body.children[1] for <p> or [0] for <h1> in the example
all depending on where elements are in the HTML code, if code changes the DOM address changes too

changes layout and added new <p> element and id for the link, to use query function
document.getElementById method
let anchorElement = document.getElementById("external-link");
anchorElement.href = "http://www.google.com";

querySelector method can be used also
anchorElement = document.querySelector("#external-link");
anchorElement.href = "http://www.bbc.com";

getElementById can only work if id given in the html code
querySelector works on any css selector eg html type <a> same as in css, will always select the 1st matching element
querySelectorAll will return all matching elements not just 1st

document.getElementById('some-id'): Select a HTML element by its ID (selects only one element, since IDs should be unique)
document.querySelector('<some-css-selector>'): Selects the first matching (!) HTML element that is met / selected by the provided CSS selector; The CSS selector can basically be any kind of valid CSS selector (e.g. ID selector, tag type selector, class selector, combined selectors etc.)
document.querySelectorAll('<some-css-selector>'): Selects ALL matching HTML elements that are met / selected by the provided CSS selector

There also are a few lesser used selection methods, that you also should've heard about:
document.getElementsByClassName('some-css-class'): Selects all HTML elements that have the provided CSS class
document.getElementsByTagName('tag'): Selects all HTML elements that are of the provided HTML tag type

completed excercise to select variables via DOM and change text in HTML code via js and DOM
